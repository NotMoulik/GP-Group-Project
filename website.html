            <h3>Gilli Danda (Indian Stick and Ball Game)</h3>
            <p>Gilli Danda is an ancient sport similar to cricket. It is played with two sticks – a long stick (Danda) and a smaller stick (Gilli). The goal is to strike the Gilli with the Danda and send it flying while fielders attempt to catch it or prevent it from traveling far. This game requires precision, hand-eye coordination, and agility.</p>
